| In Operation Uranus, the Soviets redirected the supplies needed for the Russian forces fighting in the city to two forces from the north and south of the city. Their aim was to get behind the German flanks and cut off their supply lines, thereby encircling the Germans in a risky yet successful maneuver. | Despite being outnumbered by some 10,000 men and on a losing streak to Hannibal in the recent past, the Roman forces prevailed by unexpectedly reversing the order of their formation, placing their mercenaries in the middle and the well-trained soldiers on the flanks. This change in formation took the Carthaginians by surprise, leading to a Roman victory. | Alexander the Great faced a numerically superior enemy army. He left a part of his forces to face King Porus and took the majority of his army to cross the river some 17 miles away. Despite losing in the beginning, the arrival of the rest of his remaining forces from earlier completely routed the massive army of Porus. | Sun Bin, a brilliant military tactician, made it seem like his forces were deserting by reducing the number of fires lit at night in his camp. The Wei forces, presuming desertion, were taken by surprise when they faced a full army of 100,000 men. |
