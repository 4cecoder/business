# Start a Blog for Email Collection

This guide will help you create a blog where you can collect emails and send daily advice from a GitHub repository. 

## Step 1: Building an Email List for Your Business Blog
- [ ] Choose a platform for your blog. Some popular options include [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/), and [Wix](https://www.wix.com/).
- [ ] Set up the blog on your chosen platform.
- [ ] Create a "Subscribe" or "Join Our Mailing List" feature on your blog. This will be your mechanism for collecting email addresses. 

## Step 2: Setting up Markdown to Email
- [ ] Create a new GitHub repository. You'll use this repository to store your daily advice in Markdown format.
- [ ] Connect your GitHub repository to an email platform that supports Markdown. Some options include [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), or [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/).
- [ ] Set up an automatic email delivery system. This will take the advice from your GitHub repository and send it to your email list. 

## Step 3: Setting up an Email Signup List
- [ ] Integrate your email platform with your blog. This will allow you to collect email addresses directly from your blog.
- [ ] Set up a confirmation email system. This will send an email to users after they sign up to confirm their subscription. 
- [ ] Ensure you are compliant with GDPR and other relevant privacy laws.

## Step 4: Content Creation and Management
- [ ] Create a content schedule. This will help you ensure that you have daily advice ready to be sent out. 
- [ ] Write and upload your daily advice to your GitHub repository in Markdown format.
- [ ] Review and update your email list regularly.

Remember to always provide valuable content and respect your subscribers' privacy.
